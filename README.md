# Second OOP Assignment - Water Pipes Game
## ⚡Languages: Java⚡
# ⚡Using: Swing⚡
This is the second assignment from the OOP university class. In this assignment I created a Water Pipe turning game.
You are tasked to rotate pipes (Curved, Straight, Start/End) and find the right path from Start to End so water can flow through.

## This project had a deadline so there may appear some bugs because of the time limit and my knowledge at that time
